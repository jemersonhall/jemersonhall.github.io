      <h4 id="underline">Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Born and raised in Scottsdale, AZ.  I went to Harvard University for undergrad where I studied Pscyhology. After Harvard, I spent the next four years at a boutique strategy consulting firm in Boston called Alliance Consulting Group.  I had a fantastic experience and was able to gain valuable experience with clients ranging from Fortune 500 staples (i.e., Coca-Cola and Harley-Davidson) to private equity firms making acquisitions of small to mid sized firms.
        <p>
        After finishing up my work with Alliance, I decided to get my MBA and began B School at the Kellogg School of Management in August 2014.  At Kellogg, I am focusing on Finance, Strategy, and Entreneurship classes (like this coding class!) and am involved in a variety of clubs such as Kellog Board Fellows, Insight Group mentorship, and Ski and Snowboard club.
        <p>
        Post Kellogg, I will be getting married on July 9, 2016 in Spring Lake, Michigan and then moving out to San Francisco to began my post-MBA career at Google.  I will be working in Strategy for the Android and Chrome for Work team and cannot wait for this new chapter of my life to begin.
